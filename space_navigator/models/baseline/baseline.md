# Baseline description

Baseline model represents the grid search for a collision-avoidance maneuver. This model provides the maneuver that is collinear to the velocity vector. If enabled, the model provides a reverse maneuver to return to the initial orbit as well.

Could be tuned.

<!--TODO: time of maneuver-->
