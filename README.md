# Satellite Collision Avoidance

Since 2004 the amount of space launchings has been gradually increased. Currently, there are more than 100 satellites launched into space every year. This number could be expanded rapidly due to such projects as providing global internet by Starlink. The increased amount of objects in space leads to a higher probability of their collision.

Every case of collision is currently processed manually. In this project, we investigate methods of reinforcement learning to create a system for automatic maneuver estimation in order to prevent collisions.

## Getting Started

To set up the project 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Pykep

[Instructions for install pykep](https://esa.github.io/pykep/installation.html)
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
